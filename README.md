An [AWS Professional Service](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/) open source initiative | aws-proserve-opensource@amazon.com

<img align="left" src="docs/source/_static/sail-icon.png" width="50" height="44"> The Serverless Data Lake Framework (SDLF) is a collection of reusable artifacts aimed at accelerating the delivery of enterprise data lakes on AWS, shortening the deployment time to production from several months to a few weeks. It can be used by AWS teams, partners and customers to implement the foundational structure of a data lake following best practices. It is used in production by more than thirty large organizations, including public references such as Embraer, Formula One, Hudl, and David Jones.
